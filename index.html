            <p>Sapphire is amazing. My daughters hair was in such trouble after multiple colours and S was brilliant. She was kind and caring and took the time to color correct a mess.</p>
            <p>And S also does my hair. I don’t trust my hair to anyone!</p>
            <p>Can’t wait to build a long standing relationship with my new stylist.</p>
            <p>Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Sapphire!</p>
            <p>We will see you next month!</p>
